# AR_HideAndSeek (2019)

Tried out Unity's AR system. In this game you need to look around the house and tap on different objects to see if there is someone hiding in there. If not, you'll get a hint (hot/cold). You can't see all objects through the windows, so you will need to lean in with your phone to check the insides.
